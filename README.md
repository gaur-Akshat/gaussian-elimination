# gaussian-elimination
an algorithm to solve linear equations with n variables

steps-

  first of all i want a matrix as input which will be the 'A' matrix (variables matrix)
  then i need 'b' matrix (RHS)
  then i will make the augmented matrix [A|b]
  (but i can directly input augmented matrix to continue, that will be easy)
  i will acquire the row-echelon form to proceed
  then divide the rows with their pivot elements for easy output (if the pivot is zero then swap with the another row in the same column)
  i will then compute the variables using back-substitution
  then i will print the output in clearly visible format without mess
